        <h2 class="heading">About Me</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">My name is Alex Simpson and I am working to become a future full-stack developer. I am learning various web development techniques and tools including basics, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is start a career in web development as either a front-end or full-stack engineer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Although I am still early in my path to becoming a web developer I have learned many things and I am working to learn even more. I plan to continue to update and improve this portfolio website as time goes on to show my growth as a web developer. I also plan to show off and share some of projects that I believe best show off my growing skills as I continue to work towards my goals.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Although my main focus is to work towards my goals as a full-stack engineer I also spend some of my time learning programming languages such as C++ and Python to potentially test my skills in programming working on projects for fun and giving myself a wide range of tools and knowledge.</p>
